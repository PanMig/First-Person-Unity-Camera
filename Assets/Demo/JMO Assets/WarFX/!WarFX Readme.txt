======================

PREFABS
-------
Effects are located in the "_Effects" folders, and "_Effects (Mobile)" for mobile versions.


CARTOON FX EASY EDITOR
----------------------
Open the editor in the menu:
GameObject -> CartoonFX Easy Editor

Change the options of the editor, select the GameObject(s) you want to change, and press the corresponding buttons in the editor to apply the changes.


CARTOON FX SPAWN SYSTEM
-----------------------
CFX_SpawnSystem allows you to easily preload your effects at the beginning of a Scene and get them later, avoiding the need to call Instantiate. It is highly recommended for mobile platforms!
Create an empty GameObject and drag the script on it. You can then add GameObjects to it with its custom interface.
To get an object in your code, use CFX_SpawnSystem.GetNextObject(object), where 'object' is the original reference to the GameObject (same as if you used Instantiate).
Use the CFX_SpawnSystem.AllObjectsLoaded boolean value to check when objects have finished loading.


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
* Almost all prefabs have auto-destruction scripts for the Demo scene; remove them if you do not want your particle system to destroy itself upon completion.
* Some effects might lack luminosity in Linear Color Space (Unity Pro only); you can correct this issue on a case by case basis by increasing either the Tint Color of each Material, or the Start Color on the effect's Particle System Inspector.


PLEASE LEAVE A REVIEW OR RATE THE PACKAGE IF YOU FIND IT USEFUL!
Enjoy! :)
