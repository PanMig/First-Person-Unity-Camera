======================

You can open the editor within the Unity top menu:
Window -> Cartoon FX Easy Editor

It allows you to easily change properties of the selected Particle System(s):

"Quick Edit" can change various properties in one click:
- "Scale Size" to change the size of your Particle Systems; it is different than using the Transform scale, because it will actually directly scale the relevant properties (speed, velocity, gravity, etc.).
The scaling should thus be more accurante than changing the Transform scale (even when using 'Hierarchy' scaling mode).
It will also scale lights' intensity accordingly if any are found.
Tip: If you don't want to scale a particular module, disable it before scaling the system and re-enable it afterwards!
- The other functions should be self-explanatory

"Color Edit" to easily change the colors, either by selecting the color directly, or tinting the existing colors.
This works on gradient too.

"Copy Modules" allows you to copy all values/curves/gradients/etc. from specific modules of a source Particle System to other Particle Systems.
Just select which modules you want to copy, choose the source Particle System to copy values from, select the Particle Systems you want to change, and click on "Copy properties to selected GameObject(s)".
